##Brew Mood

##About
Brew Mood is a brewery and beer web app that aims to help you find the right beer for you, based on a variety of attributes.

##Technologies
* Front end
  HTML5, CSS3, AngularJS, Bootstrap, Jquery

* Back end
  Ruby on Rails, ActiveRecord

* Database creation
  The database information is from BreweryDB.com's API. They have a premium API subscription service, though we cloned it and hosted a local copy for this project. The data is relevant as of June 2017.

##Future Iterations
This app was completed in 5 days and there are many additional features that we'd add to make this 100% and more user friendly.
1. Add a comments model so people can leave feedback and comments on breweries.
2. Add user authentication, which opens a whole realm of possibilities like user favorites, brewery checkin, more secure posting parameters.
3. Rating system for beers
4. Map to populate breweries nearby based on location services API
