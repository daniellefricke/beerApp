##Future Iterations
This app was completed in 5 days and there are many additional features that we'd add to make this 100% and more user friendly.
1. Add a comments model so people can leave feedback and comments on breweries.
2. Add user authentication, which opens a whole realm of possibilities like user favorites, brewery checkin, more secure posting parameters.
3. Rating system for beers.
4. Map to populate breweries nearby based on location services API.
5. Expand the database to include breweries from across the US and then international.
